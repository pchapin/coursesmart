I had my spring 1996 CS-212 class work on this as a class project. It
was at best only partially successful. Is it worth continuing with this
work? Or not? I'm not sure. I notice that there is a lack of design
documents so it might take me some work to reconstruct the design from
memory (and the source -- such as it is).

This subproject is not directly related to CourseSmart. However, it does
occupy a similar solution space. This subproject may or may not be useful
in the future. However, it seems worth keeping for now just in case.
