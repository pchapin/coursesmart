This file contains a list of server TODO items. The items in this list are in no particular
order of priority, importance, or difficulty.

+ Add a facility to time-out network connections in case the client vanishes without a trace.

+ Build unit test programs for Logger, UserData, and the various other main server classes.

+ Review the use of the Logger and verify that logging is being done in all appropriate places.

+ Review the use of the FileSystem lock and verify that it is being used in all appropriate
  places.

+ Improve error handling in response to file system problems.

+ Improve error handling in response to malformed client requests or invalid data in client
  requests (currently invalid data often causes a server crash). Investigate the idea of doing a
  validating parse of the client request messages.

+ Modify the CourseSmart protocol so that the server sends a banner message announcing itself
  and the CourseSmart protocol version in use. Perhaps something like

  <response type="banner" id="0" status="success">
    <protocol-version>1.0</protocol-version>
    <server-id>UVM's CourseSmart v0.01</server-id>
  </response>

  The client would need to be modified to expect this message. Probably it should also
  (initially?) send a banner request with similar information. That way clients and servers that
  support multiple protocol versions would be possibilities.

+ If there is an error parsing the CourseSmart protocol, the server never bothers to send back
  an error reponse to the client. This is a problem because the client will always expect some
  kind of response from the server (success or failure).
