    <h1>Unit 2: Information for Students</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>If you are a student, you will be interacting with the
    CourseSmart system entirely through the client. Your interface
    consists of a tabbed view with tabs for the different operations you
    can perform.</p>

    <p>Note that the content tab is a general purpose web browser. Your
    instructor might provide links to <a
    href="http://www.uvm.edu/">pages outside the immediate course
    content</a> to give you easy access to supplementary information.

    <p>Blah, blah, and furthermore blah...</p>
